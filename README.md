My assumptions:
	
	1. Matches can be finished not necessarily in the order they were started

		For example, matches may differ in length by extra time, there might be penalties, a walkover and so on.

	2. A given team cannot play more than one match at a time.

	3. I don't test Game class directly - it is tested indirectly through ScoreBoard class.
